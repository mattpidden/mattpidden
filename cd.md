## Continuous Deployment to App Stores
Continuous Deployment (CD) for mobile apps streamlines the process of building, testing, and deploying applications directly to app stores like the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This approach automates much of the manual effort required for app distribution, making it easier and faster to deliver updates and new features to users. CD is valuable across all mobile development frameworks, including Swift, Flutter, Java, Kotlin, and React Native.
### General Steps of Mobile App Deployment
1. Compile your application for the appropriate platform (iOS or Android).
2. Deploy the compiled app to the targeted app store either the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

### Benifits of CD
- CD allows you to deploy your app regardless of the operating system you're using. (This is very useful for deploying iOS apps, when your laptop is not running MacOS)
- Automating deployment reduces the time spent on repetitive manual steps.
- CD pipelines make deployment progress visible to all team members, facilitating better collaboration and tracking.

### Overview of a CD Workflow
1. Start the CD pipeline with a designated trigger, often a code push or pull request merge to the main branch.
2. Specify the operating system that the CD pipeline will use, such as macOS for iOS builds or Linux for Android.
3. Pull the latest code from the designated branch,
4. Download and install all necessary packages and dependencies
5. Load all required app signing certificates, keys, and provisioning profiles to authorize the app build for the selected platform
6. Retrieve API keys or access tokens required to communicate with the App Store
7. Compile the app for the target platform
8. Submit the compiled build to the App Store or Play Console.
9. Remove any sensitive data, temporary files, and credentials from the CD environment to maintain security.
